# 禅是什么  
**What is Zen**

禅，不在语言中，也不在经书里。  
它原意是「静虑」，意为让心安住，澄明如镜。  
禅，不是逃离尘世，而是在日常中觉醒。  
吃饭、行路、说话、沉默，皆可为禅。  

当你不再执着于分别——好与坏、得与失、我与他——  
那份**当下的清明与自在**，就是禅。  

南泉禅师说：「平常心是道。」  
禅，就是让心回到平常，而平常中见道。

# What is Zen  

Zen cannot be captured by words or scriptures.  
Its root meaning is *dhyāna* — calm reflection, still awareness.  
Zen is not an escape from life, but awakening within it.  
Eating, walking, speaking, or silence — all can be Zen.  

When you let go of distinctions — good or bad, gain or loss, self or other —  
that **clarity and freedom in the present moment** is Zen itself.  

As Master Nansen said, “Ordinary mind is the Way.”  
Zen is the return to simplicity,  
where the ordinary becomes sacred.  

> Zen is not learned, but realized from your own direct experience.
