一日，磐山禅师在庖厨帮忙，师父问：“哪一块肉是好肉？”  
磐山答：“这一块好。”  
师父又问：“哪一块不是好肉哪？”  
磐山忽然大悟。

禅，不在言句中，不在分别里。所谓“好”与“不好”，只是心的分别；若心不二，一切皆真。磐山的开悟，不因肉的优劣，而在当下洞见“无差别”的真理。  
这一句平常话，击碎了他对“好坏”的执着，见到了心外无物、当下即道的禅意。

真正的悟，不是寻找特别的道理，而是看见平凡中原本的圆满。

### English Version

One day, while helping in the kitchen, Master Panshan was asked by his teacher:  
“Which piece of meat is good?”  
Panshan replied, “This one is good.”  
The teacher then said, “Which piece is not good?”  
At that moment, Panshan was enlightened.

Zen is not found in words, nor in distinctions. “Good” and “not good” are only creations of the discriminating mind. When the mind ceases to divide, everything is whole and true.  
Panshan’s awakening did not come from the taste of meat, but from seeing the truth beyond duality — that there is no separation between good and bad.

True awakening is not about seeking something special;  
it is realizing the completeness of what already is — right here, right now.
