# 似机开悟  
**Sudden Enlightenment**

禅宗公案中常言「似机开悟」——  
一个机锋、一句话，便能令人大彻大悟。  

磐山禅师未悟时，南泉问众：「作么生是好肉？」  
众无语。南泉曰：「**哪一块肉不是好肉？**」  
磐山闻言，当下开悟。  

这一句，看似平常，却破尽分别心。  
所谓「好」与「坏」，皆由妄念所分。  
当分别止息，一切皆真，一切皆佛。  

悟，不在远方，也不需追求。  
只要心中妄想一止，当下即是光明。  

> 一语触心，顿然明白。  
> 禅者，不假修证，只在当下醒来。

# Sudden Enlightenment  

In Zen, *sudden awakening* often arises from a single phrase —  
a spark that cuts through delusion.  

When Master Panshan had not yet awakened,  
Master Nansen asked, “Which piece of meat is the best?”  
The monks were silent.  
Nansen replied, “**Which piece of meat is not good?**”  
At that instant, Panshan was enlightened.  

The words shattered duality.  
“Good” and “bad” exist only in thought.  
When judgment ceases, everything reveals its true nature.  

Enlightenment is not far away — it is here, now,  
when the mind stops chasing shadows and rests in clarity.  

> One phrase touches the heart — awakening happens in this very moment.
