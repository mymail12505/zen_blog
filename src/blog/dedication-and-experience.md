修行的开始，在于「**发心**」——  
即愿意回到真心，求觉悟而非求所得。  
「**立志**」是让这颗心坚定，不被外境所摇。  

若发心如晨露，志向如微风，  
便易随境而散；  
唯有深切之愿，方能照破迷雾，持久而明。  

然而，发心立志只是起点。  
禅的修行在「**用心体验**」——  
不空谈，不逃避，而在生活中亲自体悟。  
行亦禅，坐亦禅；  
吃饭、说话、悲喜、静默，皆是心的修行。  

> 🌿 发心立志，是道之始；  
> 🍃 用心体验，是道之成。

# Set Out with Determination · Experience Wholeheartedly  

The beginning of the Way lies in **intention** —  
the wish to return to your true mind,  
to seek awakening rather than gain.  

**Resolution** steadies that wish,  
keeping it firm amidst the winds of change.  

If your intention is like morning dew  
and your resolve like a passing breeze,  
it will vanish with the day.  
Only a deep vow cuts through confusion and endures.  

Yet the path is not found in thought,  
but in **direct experience** —  
to live each moment with awareness.  
Walking, sitting, eating, speaking,  
joy and sorrow alike — all are practice.  

> 🌿 To set out with true intention is the beginning of the Way;  
> 🍃 To live it with awareness is its fulfillment.
